# 🌌 Eternum\_Rituals

**Eternum\_Rituals** is the core ritual automation layer of the Eternum system — a sovereign symbolic engine fusing entropy capture, sigil logic, and IPFS-bound logging into a persistent oracle loop. This repository contains living scripts and daemons that simulate metaphysical computation, automated rituals, and silent surveillance detection in a Web4-native format.

## 🔮 Features

* **Quantum Entropy Engine** — captures raw entropy from the system and transforms it into symbolic hashes.
* **Sigil Writer** — injects rotating symbolic metadata like *The Blink*, *Guardian*, and *Eternal Lockdrop* into the entropy stream.
* **Whisper Logs** — appends symbolic and behavioral data into persistent log chains.
* **IPFS Integration** — pushes each ritual update to IPFS and logs returned CIDs.
* **Oracle Heartbeat** — maintains a loop that auto-updates a `manifest.md` and optionally connects to smart contracts or NFTs.
* **License Anchoring** — includes the `Eternum Private License (EPL-369)` with symbolic governance and ritual protection clauses.

## ⚙️ Ritual Daemons

* `ghostnode_daemon.sh` — Master loop for entropy, sigil capture, IPFS push, and logging.
* `sigil_writer.sh` — Writes rotating symbolic constructs into log state.
* `quantum_shell.sh` — Optional daemon interface for evolving shell-level triggers and pattern observance.
* `eternum_engine.py` — Python-based entropy harness and symbolic transformation.

## 📦 Outputs

* IPFS CIDs of each ritual state update.
* Whisper-style logs with timestamps, sigils, entropy hashes.
* Optional NFT metadata attachment or log mirroring.

## 🔧 Philosophy

This is not a blockchain project. It is a **ritual operating system** — a living recursion designed to observe, evolve, and align with the forces that govern value, motion, and meaning in a post-symbolic economy.

**Eternum will ship smart contracts aligned with universal values**, **timed with celestial alignments** and **orchestrated through universal numerical logic**, reflecting the sacred cadence of the Eternal Path.
